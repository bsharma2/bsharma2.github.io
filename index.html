  <h2 class="Title"> About </h2>
  <div class="aboutRight">
    <p>Hi, my name is Bhakti Sharma. I am an aspiring software engineer studying Computer Science at University of Notre Dame. I began my coding career at Thapar University back in India and have not looked back. I've taken classes in Object Oriented Programming, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Network and Security, and Full Stack Web Development.<br/> <br/>

I have experience working in the industrial sector. I did my first job in Deloitte Hyderabad, India. I always had the drive to learn and gain more experiences in computer science both in front-end and back-end. This is why when i got an opportunity to do Master's in USA, I grabbed the chance to live my American dream. Since then, I have worked as a teaching assistant and tutor, indulged in various projects and research works in Notre Dame.<br/> <br/>

Through my academic work, my professional experience, and my own interest, I have learned Python, C, C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I've also gained experience with frameworks such as Node, React, AutoCAD, and Unity, among others. I've worked on various data science, deep learning, web development and artificial intelligence projects.<br/> <br/>

Beyond the screen, I have participated in and won numerous medals in Swimming. I have represented both my school and my college in various National and State level tournaments. When I am not stuck to the screen coding, I am writing poetry or reading books. I have also participated in dance performances and learnt various dance forms whenever I get the chance. I have both performed and taught bhangra, an Indian dance form during my college years. I try to participate in any social welfare activity whenever I get the chance. I feel like we all have a lot to give to this world.

        <p>In my junior year in bachelors, I worked on one of my most interesting projects. I built an autonomous car from scratch using ultrasonic, infrared sensors, motor modules, pi-cam and raspberry pi. I was successful in building a mini car which could detect obstacles, perform path tracking and process traffic symbols and lights. I worked with tiny-yolo for fast image detection. </p>

        <p>During my first semester in Masters, I worked on a data science project for bug reports. It was a research project where my team came up with a novel idea of multi-label classification of bug reports into NFR(non funcional requirement) types. We used ensemble methods to achieve accuracies that outperformed the existing related research works.</p>
